A collection of beautiful, customizable Gutenberg blocks for the new block editor.

== Description ==

Atomic Blocks is a collection of content blocks for the new [Gutenberg](https://atomicblocks.com/beginners-guide-gutenberg/?utm_source=WP.org%20Description%20Gberg%20Link&utm_campaign=wporg_desc_gberg_link) block editor. Blocks are chunks of content such as paragraphs, images, galleries, columns, and more. Building with blocks gives you more control to quickly create and launch any kind of site you want!

Adding the customizable Atomic Block plugin adds a collection of beautiful, site-building blocks to help you customize page layouts, increase engagement, and get results for your business.

Along with the content blocks you'll find in Atomic Blocks, we're also publishing helpful articles and tutorials to help you get started with Gutenberg.
