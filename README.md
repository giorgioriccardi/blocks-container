# SSWS Gutenberg Blocks Container
Gutenberg blocks container helps you create useful and reusable front-end templates with the new WordPress editor.

# How to use `Blocks Container`
1. Select **SSWS Blocks Container** from the Common blocks list
2. Within the container create your strucutre/template
3. Save it as re-usable template
4. Right now if you use it in another post/page, unless you want to change it across all the site, you need to convert it into blocks
5. Hopeffully in the future I will be able to create indpendent instances of the template each time the re-usable block gets called in a new post/page
